# ATKOS
Let's start with some questions
> What is this gay thing?
*Well, ATKOS is a small RPG Project made by a group of semifriends. It should have a map generator, and focus heavily on RNG*

> When will it be out
*No idea, just doing this to learn*

> What programming language will this be in?
*WPF C#, and whatever else we deem necessary in the future*

> What faggots are helping?
*Autonomy is the main project man,  MackMTP2 is the secondary project man, with Viking and Ludlad as helpermans, and Noalot as (hopefully) an artist if he can ever find some time to remove my awful default stuff*

> What are you working on now?
*No idea, I'm tired*
